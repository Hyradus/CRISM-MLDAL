# CRISM-MLDAL - Machine Learning Data Analysis Tool

Scripts to read, extract, assemble features and mineral classes to train a ML.

## Brief description.

What is a MTRDR? A map-projected Targeted Reduced Data Record (MTRDR) consists of the TER corrected I/F spectral information after map projection and the removal of spectral channels with suspect radiometry (“bad bands”).  See https://bit.ly/2IuEkIT for detailed informations.

MTRDR are available for download from MARS Orbital Data Explorer website: https://bit.ly/339xJNF

Downloaded images consist of different files, the most important are the *.img (data file) and *.hdr (ancillary metadata file).

This repository is composed by:

- a simple configuration file in csv format (SpIndex_Minerals.csv), in which there are two columns, Spectral bands (1st) and Relative mineral (2nd).

- SpIdx_To_Dicts.py: a script that iterate over all files of a user-specified folder and look for every spectral band specified into the configuration file and:
    1) Extract the original data and store it into a dump file and a *.png;
    2) Apply a mask for NaN values, apply a user defined threshold (default is 10) and store into a *.npy array and a *.png;
    3) Convert the masked, tresholded image into a boolean image and store into a *.npy array and a *.png.
    
- image_to_features.py: a script that read files exported with SpIdx_to_Dicts.py, converts them into a series and create a csv pandas dataframe and a boolean csv for each relative mineral specified in the configuration file.
In the pandas dataframe columns are spectral indexes (e.g. OLINDEX3) and rows are the pixels of the image with relative DN values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run both of the scripts the following modules are needed to be installed:
- Rasterio 
- spectral
- numpy
- cv2
- pandas

A requirements.txt files is also provided.

If you are using conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge rasterio
conda install -c conda-forge spectral
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install -c conda-forge 
```

### Installing

To install it, just clone the repository and double check the prerequisites.

# Data organization

Datasets download from Mars Orbital Data Explorer should be extracted into separated folders, named as the dataset and that contain all files.

Using the various scripts, different sub-folders will be created automatically

- Dataset folder contains:
    - Extracted - contains all the files generated by Multiple_Band_extractor and:
        - Processed - files generated by Features-Target_creator and:
        - Bandname_models folder for each band processed that contains DecisionTree and RandomForest models plus some evaluation datas


# Multiple_Band_extractor

Given a dataset folder it reads all the img files and their associated hdr file that are necessary to read correctly the BAND_NAME of the img.

To avoid duplicates, if a band is already extracted, it will be skipped.
A threshold based filter is applied to each band, to remove datas under a certain values. This value si computed for each image and correspond to a nTh percentile (default 20th percentile but user can input different value). This percentile is calculated excluding the NaN values present.
Then original images are saved into a sub-folder called "Extracted" as:

- dump file for original
- numpy array (*.npy) for thresholded
- image file (*.png) for both original and thresholded
- In addition a csv file, containing all the unique band names in a single column is generated.


# Features-Target_creator

Users must select:
- the "Extracted" folder
- a file that contains the unique band names that wiill be converted into features and target.
    - Can be selected the csv file created by Multiple_Band_extractor script
    - Can be selected a user personal csv containing only the desired bands. Be aware that unique band names must be exactly the same band names extracted. e.g. OLINDEX3 band must be OLINDEX3 in the csv, cannot be Olindex3, or similar. (Could be improved in further developments)
- Two files are generated and saved into a sub-folder "Processed"
- dataset-name_features: a csv file containing all the selected bands and the respective values in columns
dataset-name_classes: a csv file containing all the selected bands and the respective boolean values in columns. 

# ML_Multiple-single_class_trainer

Users must select:

- the "Processed" folder
- the same csv file that contains the unique band names
- the dataset-name_features
- the dataset-name_features 

The script will then:

- create a folder with the band names
- train specific models for each band included into the features/classes files
- compute for each model:
    - the confusion matrix for Decision Trees and Random Forest: plot
    - the classification report for Decision Trees and Random Forest: plot and save
    - the feature score combined graph for Decision Trees and Random Forest: plot and save 
    - tree graph for Decision Trees


# Multi-model_single-target_predictor

Users must select:
- the folder where are located the files (pkl) of model pairs (Decision Trees and Random Forest). Minimum 1 pair, maximum to be tested (i have tried up to 5 model)
- the dataset_name_features generated by Features-Target_creator with the same amout of bands

The script will then:
- compute predictions for each given model
- generate combined graph showing the results of the prediction

# Detailed description

## Description of Specialized Browse Product Mosaics

Original datasets are Map-Projected Targeted Reduced Data Records (MTRDR) contain TER data map-projected using terrain models of the Martian surface. 

Downloaded from Mars Orbital Data Explorer portal (https://ode.rsl.wustl.edu/mars/) and organized into relative folders.

Those datasets contains Spectral summary parameters thate are band math calculations that quantify diagnostic or indicative spectral structure and collectively capture the mineralogical diversity of the surface. Mathematical functions applied to reflectance values at key wavelengths allow the relative depth of particular absorption features (for example) to be quantified, and produce grayscale images indicating the presence or absence of particular phases. 

A more detailed description of original datasets could be find here: http://crism.jhuapl.edu/msl_landing_sites/index_news.php

Processed dataset were all created with SpIdx_to_Dict.py script on specific original datasets to extract user-selected Spectral summary parameters in different formats.
